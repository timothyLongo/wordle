# Wordle
Wordle in C++ (windows command prompt word game)

How to play:

1 - Open WORDLE.sln visual studio project

2 - Edit line 381 to edit directory to that of your local machine's location of DICTIONARY.txt

3 - Save changes

4 - Run executable file under x64\Debug\WORDLE.exe

BEWARE - The dictionary has a mind of its own

It has just as much fun conuring up gobbledygook as it does speaking english
